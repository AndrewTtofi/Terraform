This repository is used for my journey with Terraform. As I am still new to Cloud Computing, I strongly believe that learning side by side Cloud Technologies with Infrastructure
as code will benefit my journey to becoming a successful DevOps Engineer.

For starters I have created somme basic resources with the use of Terraform (project1.tf) which include EC2 instances, VPCs and a bit of subnets.
I will try to create a fully functional project on AWS that will alllow me to test my knowledge on:
  1. EC2 Instances
  2. Dyanmo DB
  3. VPCs
  4. Subnets
  5. Lambda Functions
  6. SQS
  7. SNS

Since all of the above will be tested as part of my journey to obtain the Solution Architect Certificate from Amazon best practices from AWS must be applied.
