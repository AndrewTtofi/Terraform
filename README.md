# Terraform - gotta love this kind of stuff
Enter each file to get a feeling of what I am doing.
The order in which you should go through everything is:
  1. Introduction
  2. FirstProject-WebServer

Note that in order to use my code you need to first install Terraform, install Amazon CLI and link your AWS IAM user for code-deployment through both.
If you need further assistance on the steps and how to run the code you can contact me.
